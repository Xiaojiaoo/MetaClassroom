MetaClassroom is a programming learning world based on virtual metaverse technology, designed to introduce students to fundamental programming knowledge. The design of this 3D virtual learning world stems from a reflection on traditional teaching methods and a vision for the future of education. The goal is for learners to study in a virtual metaverse environment, where they can independently choose learning materials and resources, allocate their study time wisely, and engage in a blend of learning and play.
The main features of this metaverse learning world include: (1) A knowledge corridor for free-form learning; (2) A collection of multimedia learning resources; (3) Educational games to support teaching; (4) E-textbooks for self-directed learning; (5) Virtual classrooms and instructors; (6) A website bookshelf curating quality online learning resources; (7) A memory tree to reinforce foundational knowledge; (8) A data dashboard tracking learning progress.

The learning world is divided into different learning zones: the Knowledge Corridor, Video Learning Area, Game Teaching Zone, Textbook Library, Hotspot Word Cloud Zone, Virtual Classroom, Website Bookshelf, Knowledge Graph Memory Zone, Data Dashboard, and more. The following sections will introduce the entire educational metaverse world through these different zones.
The Knowledge Corridor serves as a key place for free browsing and selecting learning content in the 3D virtual learning world. The walls display key knowledge points from various information technology disciplines, covering a wide range of topics and concepts, including but not limited to programming languages, data structures, and network technologies. This diverse presentation offers learners abundant resources and a wide range of choices.
The Video Learning Area provides multimedia learning resources for students. The video-based learning method can present abstract and complex concepts like data structures in an intuitive manner, allowing students to better understand the principles and applications of programming languages in a more straightforward and concrete way.
The Game Learning Zone features multiple educational games designed around programming. These games offer an interactive and entertaining way for students to learn. By participating in these games, students can make the learning process more engaging, stimulating, and challenging, which in turn sparks their interest in learning.
The Textbook Library is designed to provide learners with the necessary e-textbooks to support self-directed learning and exploration. It houses a collection of standard textbooks required for high school information technology courses, covering various topics and concepts related to the field.

The Virtual Classroom provides a digital platform where teachers can conduct lessons, demonstrations, or discussions through virtual live broadcasts, eliminating the need for on-site teaching and offering a more flexible learning environment. Students can enter the virtual classroom according to the course schedule and participate in lessons through the virtual platform.
